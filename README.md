# Population-Pyramid-Animation

Visualization is an excellent way to communicate insights found in the data.

It is a well known fact that the population of Canada is aging. This project aims to show the popluation pyramid of Canada from 1960 to 2018. This is easily achieved through animating the population pyramid over time.

The dataset was created at the [World Bank website](https://databank.worldbank.org).
Population data was retrieved for Canada from the specified years. The data was brought into R, cleaned, plotted and animated.

To follow along, the dataset may be found [here](github.com/SiphuLangeni/Population-Pyramid-Animation/blob/master/CAPop.csv).
